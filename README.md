# Home-Automation-Project-using-Raspberry-pi-pico
Objective :
The objective of this project is to provide a design or pattern that can be used to implement real-time remote control on everyday electronics. The goal of this project is to implement real-time control of home appliances and other electrical components through Mobile Phones. 

This project contributes to the IOT ecosystem in the sub-division of Home Automation. This project and its implementation show a unique way to easily implement real-time monitoring of home appliances. It also shows how to implement a robust, rigid and secure home control and monitoring system using opensource software and simple and inexpensive hardware without replacing existing electrical components.

Components used:
1. Raspberry Pi Pico
2. HC-05 Bluetooth Module
3. Breadboard
4. Jumper Wires
5. 4 Channel Relay Module
6. Bulb Holder
7. Bulb
8. Programming language used - Micro Python

The basic app is built with the website "Kodular Creator". Website link - https://www.kodular.io/creator/
